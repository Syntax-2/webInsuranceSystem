## Insurance Company System
Project that i did few years ago for my class on the insurance system, developed using plain PHP and SQL and little to none Pyhon for PHPMailer.

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a user-friendly and accessible server program for an insurance company, along with designing the database and developing a prototype of the client-server program. Upon registration, users will be able to order their desired insurance policies.

# Project Goals
The primary objective is to provide people with a tool that offers insurance services, allowing them to easily order suitable insurance from the comfort of their homes. The deployment of the server program will be made understandable without requiring extensive technical knowledge, and the program will be accessible from any phone or computer.
